          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <p>Our approach of crowdfunding carbon removal is new - we understand that you probably have some questions
            . Here are some that we are often asked along with our responses. If you would like to know more about
            us, or have a concern that wasn’t addressed here, please <a href="#">contact us</a>.</p>

                <p>Although we are a not-for-profit organisation, we still have bills to pay to keep Carbon Bins up
                  and running. From each $3 donation made via one of our Carbon Bin devices, we keep $0.50 to help
                  contribute to our operating costs. The remaining $2.50 will go directly to the purchase of Forest
                  Offsets from CNCF.</p>
                <p> Transparency and trust are core values of ours. Details of each Forrest Offset purchased by Carbon
                  Bins will be made available on the website soon.</p>

              </a>
              <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p> As trees grow, they use the energy of sunlight and through the process of photosynthesis take
                  carbon
                  dioxide from the air and water from the ground. In the process of converting it into wood they
                  release oxygen into the air. In addition to the CO<sup>2</sup> that trees capture, they also help soil
                  capture significant amounts of carbon.</p>

              <div class="uk-accordion-content"><p>Carbon Bins doesn’t plant the trees that remove carbon from the
                  atmosphere. Rather, we raise funds so that we can pay other parties to do this for us – we crowdfund
                  carbon removal.</p>

              <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Why the focus on planting trees?</a>
              <div class="uk-accordion-content"><p>The world has delayed reducing carbon emissions for so long that
                  humanity will need to suck enormous amounts of carbon dioxide back out from the air to avoid
                  catastrophic global warming. Technologies that suck carbon dioxide out of the air - known as
                  ‘negative emissions technologies’ - are needed to achieve this. Planting trees is a biological
                  negative emissions technology and scientific evidence shows that planting trees is still one of the
                  most effective and low-cost ways to remove carbon pollution from the atmosphere. There is a range of
                  other negative emissions technologies currently in use or development. You can find out more about
                  these technologies here.</p></div>

              <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Is this just carbon offsetting by another name?
              </a>
              <div class="uk-accordion-content"><p>No, it is so much more.</p>
                <p>Carbon offsets involve a business, a government, or an individual paying someone else to remove a
                  given quantity of carbon from the atmosphere. And yes, people can do this via Carbon Bins. Thinking
                  about climate change as a waste management problem, it’s the equivalent of putting your own rubbish in
                  the bin.</p>
                <p>But why stop with your own rubbish? If we all pitched in to pick up an extra piece of rubbish and
                  put it in the bin then we all benefit from a clean community. Let’s do the same for our carbon waste.
                  Carbon Bins goes beyond ‘traditional’ carbon offsetting by encouraging and allowing individuals to bin
                  carbon pollution - even if it’s not theirs.</p>

              <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What can I do to reduce the amount of carbon waste I create?</a>
              <div class="uk-accordion-content"><p>We urge people to change their behaviours so as to generate less
                  carbon dioxide. Reducing our CO<sup>2</sup> output is vital to keeping the Earth’s life sustaining
                  systems intact. We have to make less - and then bin the rest!</p>
                <p>We need to reduce our output to zero and we need to do it fast. We believe that significant climate
                  action can start at home and that households can lead a societal move towards a carbon free
                  economy.</p>
                <p> There is a plethora of excellent information and guidance available on how individuals can reduce
                  the amount of carbon waste they generate. We have listed some of these on our RESOURCES page. Also
                  keep an eye out for an upcoming blog post on this topic here.</p>

              </a>
              <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                <p>No, there are seven main greenhouse gases:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Carbon dioxide (CO<sup>2</sup>), mainly from fossil fuel use and cutting down and burning forests
                  </li>
                  <li>Methane (CH4), mainly from animals and waste</li>
                  <li>Nitrous oxide (N2O), mainly from agriculture</li>
                  <li>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), mainly from refrigerants</li>
                  <li>Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), mainly from the electricity industry</li>
                  <li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), mainly from aluminium production</li>
                  <li>Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), mainly from production of silicon wafers, liquid crystal displays and
                    silicon-based solar cells.
                  </li>
                </ul>


                <p> However, too much CO<sup>2</sup> in the atmosphere is the biggest driver of climate change. In the
                  context of
                  climate change, ‘carbon’ is commonly used as a shorthand expression for all greenhouse gasses.</p>

              <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What are carbon credits and how do they work?</a>
              <div class="uk-accordion-content"><p>
                  Carbon credits are issued from emissions reduction projects that:
                <ul>
                  <li>remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere, for example, planting more trees, which
                    sequester - or capture - carbon from the atmosphere
                  </li>
                  <li>avoid greenhouse gas emissions, for example replacing fossil fuel-derived energy with energy from
                    renewable sources, or
                  </li>
                  <li>capture destroy emissions, for example methane gas capture from wastewater.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every tonne of emissions reduced results in the creation of one carbon credit. A carbon credit is
                  a tradeable certificate that represents the avoidance or removal of one tonne of carbon
                  emissions.</p>
                <p> Carbon credits are issued to projects in Australia and overseas which can demonstrate that they have
                  been verified to reduce or remove carbon emissions. For example, if a project has been verified to
                  reduce emissions by 20 tonnes, then it is eligible to receive 20 carbon credits.</p>
                <p>When the carbon credit is retired (or 'cancelled' in some registries) it is removed from circulation
                  in that registry and cannot be used again by another buyer.</p>
