          <h1>How CarbonBins<br/>works.</h1>
          <p>The world has delayed reducing carbon emissions for so long that humanity will need to suck enormous amounts of carbon dioxide back out from the air to avoid catastrophic global warming. We see this challenge as a waste management problem. We have ways to clean up our rubbish, sewerage and streets - why not our carbon waste? Carbon Bins provides a solution to this by crowdfunding the removal of CO<sup>2</sup>  from our atmosphere.</p>
          <h2>Put carbon waste in a Carbon Bin - one tank of petrol at a time</h2>
          <p>Small donations of around $2 are made via one of our tap-and-go Carbon Bins payment devices (we aim to have these located in cafes, bars, restaurants, service stations and supermarkets in your neighborhood soon). These small donations are pooled together until we have enough funds to purchase carbon credits from CO<sup>2</sup> Australia. CO<sup>2</sup> Australia is Australia’s longest-running carbon and biodiversity offset project developer. Funds raised by Carbon Bins will be used to purchase credits from one of CO<sup>2</sup> Australia’s reforestation projects located in Australia.</p>
